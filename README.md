# Word Slash

Welcome to **Word Slash**, a fast-paced side-scrolling game where you play as a ninja slashing through clouds of words. Type the correct words and jump high to slash the clouds before they reach you!

This project is a submission product for the UA Hackathon.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download them from the Node.js website.

### Building the Game

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the game repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MykeDuong/word-slash.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Navigate to the game directory and install the necessary packages:
    ```
    cd word-slash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

    Start the development server to play the game locally:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the game on `http://localhost:8080` (or another port if 8080 is in use, e.g. 8081).

## How to Play

- **Slash the Words**: Type the word shown in the cloud and press Enter to slash it.
- **Jump and Glide**: Press the Space bar to jump. If a word cloud is above, jump and then type the word to slash while in the air.
- **Stay Healthy**: You start with 100 HP. Each missed cloud reduces your health by 10 points. If your health reaches 0, it's game over!
- **Speed Challenge**: As you progress, the game speed increases, challenging your typing and reflexes.
